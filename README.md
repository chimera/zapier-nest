# Zapier Nest Integration

***Warning*** the Nest API has been deprecated in favor of the Google Nest API, so this code likely no longer works. A replacement is in work.

For info on how to use this integration, see https://platform.zapier.com/docs/export

You may want to delete or modify the .zapierapprc file since that links this code to a specific Custom Integration.
